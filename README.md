# FIFA-21-Career-Mode-spreadsheet-for-League-2
**Pictures at the bottom**

Spreadsheet holding career mode data about your team and players, updated from 2018 version: https://github.com/R4lfXD/Fifa-19-career-mode-history-spreadsheet-for-english-football

First, please download the "CHECK ME! Instructions" file and look around for bubbles that will explain you how to use the file and what to edit. The file also has examples
filled in for refference, so you know how it should look for you later.

Don't get overwhelmed and discouraged by all the different things! Even if you only use the basic player stats like apps, goals and assists, IMO you will still find this sheet
incredibly useful to easily see cummulative stats of your players over all seasons you play.

When you're ready, you can get the "FIFA 21 template" file and edit it to your own liking.
The base club I chose is Bradford City, but of course, rename and color to colors of your own club. You can enter their historical achievements, stats and more.

Check back on the instructions file once in a while when you encounter problems or forget what is purpouse of which feature.

**Quick Feature List :**
- Record stats of your players in each competition, including their positions, age, nationality, growth, potential and personal ingame stats!
- Record your clubs signings, worth, incoming youth players, injuries, loans, and more!
- Record all of your teams matches, including score versus each competitor in the game. You will never have to wonder if you beat this team already in the past, you can just check within a second!
- See your leagues progression throughout the season, as teams rise and drop.
- Record your teams achievements, including historical stats and records, to fully immerse yourself in your playthrough.
- **It's automated** - you have to do much less work than it seems like, many things are filled in automatically by the other ones you fill in

**Tips for editing** (optional)**:**  
- For club logo use Wikipedia site of the club.
- For club season finishes, use Wikipedia site of the clubs seasons (ie. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Charlton_Athletic_F.C._seasons) as well as Transfermarkt's site of the club
- For club stadium and kit photos, use google images.
- For club record holding strikers, use Wikipadia site of the club players (ie. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Charlton_Athletic_F.C._players), in biggers clubs site of records and statistics (ie. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arsenal_F.C._records_and_statistics)
- For club rivalries use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_rivalries_in_the_United_Kingdom and find VS stats of the two on http://www.soccerbase.com/
- For club achievements, use clubs oficial site as well as their Wikipedia site.
- For player nationalities use Wikipedia, open pictures in new tab, right click and copy, and paste right into the file.
- For highlights of goals, use either imgur for a gif, or streamable for a video, and enter as hyperlink.

And thats it!
